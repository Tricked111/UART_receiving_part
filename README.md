# UART receiving part
UART - receiving part
# First part of the project - Perimeter design
A connection operation scheme for receiving asynchronous serial line data was developed.
## Asynchronous serial communication
Asynchronous serial communication has become the primary method of data transfer between computers and peripheral devices. It is currently used mainly in the field of embedded systems. In serial communication, a single data wire is sufficient to transfer data between two nodes, over which the individual data bits are sent in sequence.
## Second part of the project - Implementation and debugging
Implementation of the previously developed scheme in the VHDL language.
